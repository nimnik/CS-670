Here is the list of modifications that I have done to the written presentation based on your feedbacks:

- I have added a paragraph before the last plots of the document, explaining more about the details of the BERT model that I have used.

- I have added a paragraph before the last plots of the “Modeling - Linear Regression for Time Series Dataset” section, explaining more about the details of the plots provided.

- I have added comments to the R code blocks of Classification and Linear Regression sections in order to make the functionality of the code blocks more clear.
